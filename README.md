Lineage.ai empowers the Web3 and AI community by facilitating content and IP creation and data tracking

## The Problem
Large Language Models (LLMs) trained by big corporations are trained on large amount of data from the internet. It is more likely than not that some data/content is IP protected and the IP holders are not properly compensated. At the same time, it is nearly impossible for people outside the corporations to check whether certain data is used towards training and argue for IP rights.

## Our Solution

We protect the rights of both content providers and data scientists

For content providers,
- Mint content and create correspond IP policies for model training.
- Check if a piece of content is used for a finetuned model minted on Lineage.ai.
- Get compensated when a piece of minted IP is licensed for model training.

For Data Scientist
- Browser through minted content, check corresponding IP policies, and license content.
- Track content used for training and make it verifiable on blokchain.
- Be content (model) providers and get compensated.
